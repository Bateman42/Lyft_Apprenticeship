# Lyft_Apprenticeship
This simple application written in ruby and store on the master branch,
all you need is to open folder lift_test in your source-code editor and navigate to the derectory lift_test in your terminal so you can test it buy entering this command:
 curl -X POST https://lyft-interview-test.glitch.me/test --data '{"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

task: 
The application only needs to do the following:
Accept a POST request to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut”
Return a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string
(e.g.) If you POST {"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}, it will return: {"return_string": "muydv"}.

Note: To see expected behavior you can test against a current working example with the command: 
curl -X POST https://lyft-interview-test.glitch.me/test --data '{"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
